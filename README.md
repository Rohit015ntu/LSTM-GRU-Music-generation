# Deep Learning Music Generation 🎵

This project explores music generation using Deep Learning techniques, specifically **Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)** and **Gated Recurrent Units (GRU)** networks. The models are trained on a dataset of MIDI files to learn musical patterns and generate new, original musical sequences.

## 🚀 Features
- **Data Preprocessing**: Converts MIDI files into note sequences using `music21`.
- **Model Architectures**:
  - **LSTM**: Captures long-term dependencies in musical sequences.
  - **GRU**: A more efficient variant of RNNs for sequence modeling.
- **Music Generation**: Generates new notes based on a seed sequence.
- **MIDI Reconstruction**: Converts generated note sequences back into playable MIDI files.
